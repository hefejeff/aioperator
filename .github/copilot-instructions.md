- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Created instructions file in workspace/.github.)

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Project already defined as Vite React + TypeScript with Firebase/Gemini services.)

- [x] Scaffold the Project (Existing Vite React project already present; skipped re-running `npx create-vite@latest .` to avoid overwriting files.)

- [x] Customize the Project (No new customizations requested beyond existing feature set; ready to adjust when user provides further requirements.)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (No additional extensions recommended by project setup info.)

- [x] Compile the Project (Installed deps with npm install; `npm run build` succeeds under Node 18 with dynamic import and size warnings noted.)

- [x] Create and Run Task (Not required; npm scripts already cover build and dev workflows.)

- [x] Launch the Project (Started `npm run dev`; Vite server running at http://localhost:5173/.)

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README.md verified current; removed HTML comment scaffolding from this checklist.)

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
