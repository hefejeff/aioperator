## 3. Typography

Our typography is clean, modern, and highly legible, reflecting our "clear and human" voice.

### Font Family
- **Primary Font**: Arial

### Hierarchy & Usage
- **Headlines**: Use **Arial Bold**. Keep headlines concise, ideally sticking to a maximum of two lines. Use a large font size and a strong color like Grounded Blue.
- **Subheads**: Use Arial Bold or a standard weight. Accent colors can be used for emphasis on primary subheads.

## 4. Logo Usage

The West Monroe logo is our primary brand identifier and must be used consistently.

### Primary Logo
The logo consists of the symbol mark and the lowercase "west monroe" wordmark.

### Rules
- **Clear Space**: Always maintain a generous amount of clear space around the logo. This space should be free of any other text, graphics, or distracting elements.
- **Sizing**: Ensure the logo is always reproduced at a size where the "west monroe" wordmark is clearly legible. Avoid scaling the logo down to a point where it becomes unreadable.
- **Placement**: The logo is typically placed in the top-left corner of a composition, as seen in our standard templates.

### Do's & Don'ts
- **DO**: Use the primary Grounded Blue logo on a white or light-colored background.
- **DO**: Ensure proper clear space is maintained.
- **DON'T**: Stretch, distort, rotate, or alter the logo in any way.
- **DON'T**: Recolor the logo outside of approved primary brand colors (e.g., a white reverse version for dark backgrounds).
- **DON'T**: Place the logo on a cluttered or visually complex background.

## 5. Imagery

Our imagery helps to tell our story, visualize data, and add a personal touch to our communications.

- **Color**: Accent colors can be used within illustrations to emphasize key components.

### Icons
- **Purpose**: Use icons to complement your message, especially in infographics or to symbolize a concept. They should be clean, simple, and stylistically consistent.

## 6. Layout & Composition

Our layouts are structured, clean, and designed to guide the audience through the content logically.

### Grid & Spacing
- Use a clean, organized grid system. Align elements logically (e.g., strong left-alignment for text).
- Be generous with white space to avoid clutter and improve readability.

### Common Layout Elements
- **Headers**: Every slide or document should have a clear, powerful header that states the big idea.
- **Highlight Graphic**: Use the built-in highlight graphic layout to spotlight impactful words in key messages.
